# Hi there üêß
I'm Cezarin, I do Web Development.

## Things you might like to know üßê
- I don't usually use GitHub at all, so don't mind the emptiness.
- If you came here looking for my projects, I privated most of them because I forgot they were public. Didn't think my old, even newer-ish half-baked projects conveyed the most accurate representation of me. GitLab and SourceHut is where I spend most of my time.

---
## Things I should add ‚ûï
- If you see a lot of weeb stuff around, it's very intentional, I don't take this account too seriously since I don't use it.
- If you ended up here, well... what can I say besides I'm sorry. Take a seat, enjoy the fireworks.

## How to contact me üîä
- **I assume you know how to find me since you came all the way here.** If not, you could try yelling very loudly, I might hear you.

## Now that I got all the boring stuff out of the way ü•≥
I like solving problems. And while it might not be the most efficient way of solving a problem I'm trying my best to solve it. I don't pride myself in being very efficient, I like overly verbose solutions that I can understand in 1, 2, even 8 years from now.

Why? Because the best solution in my opinion is the simplest to understand.

I am not really a numbers guy, maybe don't rely on me if you intend on making a complex particle simulator or a nuclear reactor. To be fair that seems like a very dumb idea (but I could handle implementing the UI). I like to deal with the more creative and fun side of programming but I do also like overly boring tasks.

Weirdness fascinates me. I like spending a lot of time learning about unusual things. I enjoy teaching people and simplifying things as much as possible. I like sociology, journalism and art.

I'm fairly awkward and nerdy. While I would consider myself a decent communicator‚Ñ¢ (not actually trademarked) at the very least from a theoretical standpoint, I do have very big issues talking in front of people. I can talk for hours about office chairs and headphones. I'm exceptionally boring and I could say that I'm someone that can be very much relied upon.

## My favorite programming languages
1. Prolog - I adore it, it's everything I want in a programming language. Since I used to teach a bit of **Logics and Argumentation** it's very close to home, and everything for me just makes sense.

2. Lua - The language that got me into programming, it's slightly more enjoyable than Python and L√∂ve is one of the most consistently good frameworks I have ever used. Fair warning that it is exceptionally ugly.

3. Go - After getting used to it's quirks it's a pretty nice language, one of the things I really like about it, is that (I think) it looks very pretty. It's just a joy to look at Go code, I don't think I ever looked at a piece of Go code and I felt like I couldn't understand it.

4. APL & BQN - Exceptionally expressive languages that can reduce complexity by changing the way you think. Plus you look exceptionally cool reading the alien symbols.

5. Haskell & Elm - Everything is very strict and that's exactly what I like about them. There's not much uncertainty when working with Haskell or Elm, but it's very mathematical approach to certain things makes it a bit of an issue for me.
